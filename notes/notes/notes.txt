TODO{
	Hitfall is inconsistent.
	Fix trippy shit happening under the stage.
	Fix so walls looks good
	Change all moves so its is always <v>, v> or vv input. (Except those that work fine backwards. Like Katana send clone, Greatsword Earth stance etc...)
	Make hit_freeze and shake amount global values.
	Increase all fast moves Freeze duration
	Going up on top of menu should take you to bottom of menu.
	Choosing character should put a better "P1" sign on it. The crystals suck...
	Dont gain meter when walking against respawning opponent.
	Make so you can adjust outline color/alpha outside shader.
	Go through all audio ffs
	Give characters a name godammit...
	Preview HEIGHT, WEIGHT and GRIP on characters.
	Make teams a thing? With different outline colors n shit.
	Make infinite cancels a game mode. (When initiating cancel_effect check game mode and give "initiator" cancels == max_cancels)
	Make the game crop images to save RAM?
	Make game sexi and funni
	Frame rate drops for some reason at times?
	Make Adventure mode

Debug tips:
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().

cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...

When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Air moves
2. Half circle moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Sweetspot hitbox needs to have:
is_priority = true;
active_frames = 1;
When spawning sweetspot hitbox:
SPAWN_NORMAL_HITBOX
[then]
SPAWN_SWEETSPOT_HITBOX


Notes in notes:
Dont use forward_down or backward_down as attack inputs
"This Is Standard Naming"
Action infos ends with a "."
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...
