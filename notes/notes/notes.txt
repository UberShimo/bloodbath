}

DOOM MODE (Roguelike){
	Includes 8 stages.
	Last stage is a mirror match with yourself that has all your UPGRADES.

	Heal
	Grow in size
	Meter regen
	Extra cancel
	Increase character speed
	Dmg based on low HP

	Slippy (Grip becomes slippy)
	Juggernaut (Hit slower but harder)
	Vampire (Gain lifesteal but loose HP over time)

	ENCOUNTERS
	Small army battle
	Giant battle
	Quick enemy battle
	
	enemy stats increase slightly each battle.
}

Debug tips:
"index" actually means "team" in most cases....
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().

cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...

When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Diagonal moves
2. Air moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Sweetspot hitbox needs to have:
is_priority = true;
active_frames = 1;
When spawning sweetspot hitbox:
SPAWN_NORMAL_HITBOX
[then]
SPAWN_SWEETSPOT_HITBOX

Notes in notes:
DONT HAVE MOVES THAT REQUIRE BACKWARD INPUT! Cuz it turns you around in chaos mode ya know...
Walls choose sprite by image_index (0: wall, 1: ground, 2: roof, 3: Platform, 4: Below stage) (32x32 image size also)
HP bar faces choose sprite by image_index (0: normal, 1: hurt, 2: dead, 3: Happy) (28x28 image size also)
"This Is Standard Naming"
Action infos ends with a "."
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...
