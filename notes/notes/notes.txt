Debug tips:
"index" actually means "team" in most cases....
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().

cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...

When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Air moves
2. Half circle moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Sweetspot hitbox needs to have:
is_priority = true;
active_frames = 1;
When spawning sweetspot hitbox:
SPAWN_NORMAL_HITBOX
[then]
SPAWN_SWEETSPOT_HITBOX


Notes in notes:
Walls choose sprite by image_index (0: wall, 1: ground, 2: roof, 3: Platform, 4: Below stage) (32x32 image size also)
HP bar faces choose sprite by image_index (0: normal, 1: hurt, 2: dead, 3: Happy) (28x28 image size also)
"This Is Standard Naming"
Action infos ends with a "."
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...
