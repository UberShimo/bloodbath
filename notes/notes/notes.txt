TODO{
	Fix trippy shit happening under the stage.
	Change all moves so its is always <v>, v> or vv input. (Except those that work fine backwards. Like Katana send clone, Greatsword Earth stance etc...)
	Going up on top of menu should take you to bottom of menu.
	Choosing character should put a better "P1" sign on it. The crystals suck...
	Dont gain meter when walking against respawning opponent.
	Make so you can adjust outline color/alpha outside shader.
	Make teams a thing? With different outline colors n shit.
	Go through all audio ffs
	Make game sexi and funni
	Frame rate drops for some reason at times?
	Make Adventure mode
}

SLOGANS for trailer n stuff
[	FAST	FREEFORM	FUN		INTENSE		UNIQUE	PLAY HOW THE **** YOU WANT		GAMEPLAY	]

Debug tips:
Is hitbox mask same as sprite?
Is hitbox collision Automatic per Frame?
Is hurtbox collision Manual per Frame?
All pressed buttons work with buffer numbers. Gotta use if(a_pressed > 0) to check the input.
Keep an eye out for reset_buffers(), reset_physics().

cancel eff works when things goes in this order:
1. Set sprite
2. Subtract from cancels
3. Spawn cancel eff
4. Set recover alarm etc...

When checking attack input it has to get checked in this order:
1. Air moves
2. Half circle moves
3. Quarter circle moves
4. Normal ground moves

Sweetspot hitbox needs to have:
is_priority = true;
active_frames = 1;
When spawning sweetspot hitbox:
SPAWN_NORMAL_HITBOX
[then]
SPAWN_SWEETSPOT_HITBOX


Notes in notes:
Dont use forward_down or backward_down as attack inputs
"This Is Standard Naming"
Action infos ends with a "."
Hurtbox = sprite collision
Attack collision = purple sprites
We are not using particles since we cant manipulate it good enough. Slow mo, scaling per dmg etc...
Dont fuck with image angle on attacks...
